<p>@CrustyBumbler@mstdn.social Iâ€™ve heard a lot of mixed reviews so Iâ€™ve been scared if Iâ€™m honest! Itâ€™s the only electric grinder I can afford thatâ€™s apparently espresso capable but Iâ€™ve also heard of a lot of people dunking on it, saying itâ€™s overrated and there are better grinders for more money etc.</p><p>Do you use it for espresso? Either way, Iâ€™d love to hear more! Any tips for when it gets delivered? ðŸ˜Š</p>
