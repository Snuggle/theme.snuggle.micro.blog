<p>@katnjiapus@toot.site @Amber@toot.site At the risk of feeling silly, does wpa_supplicant manage Ethernet connections too?</p><p>Because NetworkManager manages my Ethernet, WiFi and VPNs, but wpa_supplicant only has wpa in the name which makes me think of WPA2/3 the security thingo for WiFi so is there a different software stack that manages Ethernet orâ€¦?</p>
