<p><span class="h-card" translate="no"><a href="https://tech.lgbt/@arch" class="u-url mention">@<span>arch</span></a></span> I’ve not been able to actually clone the cards I want because of the encryption, so I’m curious if there’s a workaround or are those implants only useful for non-encrypted NFC tag cloning?</p>
