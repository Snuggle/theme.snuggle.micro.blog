<p>@CrustyBumbler@mstdn.social Oh wow, thank you so much for this! And yeah, hah, the Iberital MC2 was the exact grinder I was torn between but it seemed like a UX nightmare, plus I noticed how grubby they got. The final thing that swayed my decision was the fact the Sage was on a big sale, so I got a brand new one for the price of a used MC2. I think Iâ€™m glad after what youâ€™ve said and canâ€™t wait to try it out! ðŸ˜Š</p>
