<p>I am baffled by how many convenience stores still have a £5 minimum card charge.</p><p>You’re a convenience store… and I just want a single small drink (maybe a chocolate bar too) so I don’t dehydrate, but you’re telling me I now need to buy and carry multiple litres around all day, just to use your store? Sounds… pretty uh… inconvenient, no?</p><p>I think I’ll just go to Tesco, instead.</p>
