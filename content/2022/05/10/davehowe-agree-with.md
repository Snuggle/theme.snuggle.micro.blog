<p><span class="h-card" translate="no"><a href="https://ioc.exchange/@DaveHowe" class="u-url mention">@<span>DaveHowe</span></a></span> Agree with #1, but for #2 I don’t think I’ve carried cash for a decade, most of the vending machines here are card payment by default, but if you only have cash, then they are exact change. Same for buses. Some stores here have even stopped taking cash all together, cash is on the way out…</p><p>My local supermarket also have coinless trollies now, too… (not that I use them, I don’t own a car so can’t buy that much bulk shopping)</p>
