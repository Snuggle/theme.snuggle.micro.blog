<p><span class="h-card" translate="no"><a href="https://ioc.exchange/@DaveHowe" class="u-url mention">@<span>DaveHowe</span></a></span> The target audience though, I’m in a rush to the train station and thirsty!</p><p>This isn’t a supermarket where people are trying to compare prices and save money, it’s a tiny convenience store on the walk towards a train station. I’d prefer to spend an extra £1 per item, so I don’t miss my train, have to buy another train ticket and seriously ruin my morning.</p><p>I don’t have a way to carry a week’s shopping. I don’t see why they’re getting angry at their customers for that?</p>
