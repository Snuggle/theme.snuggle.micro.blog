<p>@forever@fedi.nullob.si <span class="h-card" translate="no"><a href="https://outerheaven.club/users/meeper" class="u-url mention">@<span>meeper</span></a></span> oh gosh, this is why I shouldnâ€™t be on *the internet* past 3am, Iâ€™m confusing everything up ðŸ˜… </p><p>I think friendly named animal technology helps me not feel upset when things go wrong or something is lacking. I just canâ€™t be mad at the happy salamander or little ducks, theyâ€™re trying their bestâ€¦ thatâ€™s why Iâ€™ll always be team Firefox, even if it means I canâ€™t see half of the web anymore because Google decided they standardise the internetâ€¦ cute friendly tech wins, not spooky eye</p>
