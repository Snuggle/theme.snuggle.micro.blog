<p>@marsupialgutz@stop.voring.me @forever@fedi.nullob.si oh wowie, your Nix is called Racoon! I think that is really cool ü¶ù</p><p>I absolutely love the idea of putting my entire system config on GitHub, I break so much stuff, it would really take so much anxiety inducing chaos out of my life. Too many times my plans stop because my Linux penguin won‚Äôt boot (again), I love to be able to reinstall and rollback with ease üòä</p><p>(I also run a cursed system as I replaced GNU coreutils with toybox so breakages are inevitable‚Ä¶)</p>
