It has been a long time since I've given an update on how [the server cabinet is going](https://posts.snugg.ie/posts/server-cabinet). Well, snugg.ie has had a bit of an upgrade!

<img src="uploads/2024/7f4818f79a.jpg" width="450" height="600" alt="">

As you might've noticed, we're in a totally new cabinet now! The [older wooden cabinet](https://posts.snugg.ie/posts/server-cabinet)  outlived its lifespan after a few house moves. It was also never originally designed to be disassembled, which was its biggest hindrance.

The setup has now moved into a whole new 24U enclosure (Lehmann) made of metal. It's disassemble-able and has sound-dampening foam, which gets everywhere üå®Ô∏è!
<!--more-->
## We've expanded!
- totally new network setup! New VLANs, FTTx XGS-PON full-fibre wired directly into router using a WAS-110 ONT/ONU 'on a stick' SFP+ module
- a lot more smart-home gear running through a Home Assistant ZBT-1, including [Everything presence sensors](https://shop.everythingsmart.io/products/everything-presence-lite), smart light bulbs (Philips Hue & Twinkly), and more!
- using Docker containers for pretty much all of my services with docker-compose
- switched from Plex to Jellyfin

## What's inside?

**Top to bottom:** 
* Unifi Dream Machine Pro*
* Cisco Meraki MS225-48FP*
* Silver patch panel*
* Blanking plate*
* Cisco Meraki MX100* (currently unused)
* Homebrew Opnsense router* (currently unused)
* 10 blanking plates*
* cuddle server* (4c/4t Intel Xeon E3-1225v2 & 14 GiB DDR3)
* [hug server](https://posts.snugg.ie/posts/hug-server) (16c/32t 2x Intel E5-2630v3 & 64 GiB DDR4)
* Eaton 5PX 1500 UPS

*new!


## How much power does it all draw?

On average the whole cabinet draws 340 watts, about 8.38 kWh total a day, which using current UK energy prices is around ¬£2/day. It's an expensive hobby to keep, so bear in mind if you're looking to getting into self-hosting things yourself!
